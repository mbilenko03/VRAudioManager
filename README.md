<h2>What is this Application</h2>
<p>The purpose of this program is to have simplier way to change the user's audio and microphone in the volume mixer in a few ways. The user is able to imput what their output and input prefrences are on default and on VR. The first way the user switch is by manually using the gui to choose which setting they would like: default or VR. The second way is to identify the services they would like VR to choose that start. The application can be minimized to the tray to keep it out of the way and can be manually added to start up. To learn more about how to use this program, check the usage section below.</p>
